# Portfolio
repository for my online work portfolio. This portfolio is only for the pusposes for showcasing
programming work that I've undertaken over my coding profession and is not fo rthe purposes
of recieving pull requests.

## Viweing this page

The only requirements necessary to view the portfolio website is by clicking [here](https://gavin4.github.io/Portfolio).
This was done by using github pages to host the web page which includes an index.html page with included
Cascading Style Sheets and javascript files to accompany it.
